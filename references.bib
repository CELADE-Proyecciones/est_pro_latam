  abstract = {I develop and explain a new method for interpolating detailed fertility schedules from age-group data. The method allows estimation of fertility rates over any fine grid of ages, from eight-year age groups, using cubic splines with constraints to ensure monotonicity and non-negativity. The method is implemented in the R package bayesPop, which also includes functions for projecting fertility schedules and total fertility rates. I illustrate the method with an example using data from Brazil.},

  abstract = {Forecasts of completed fertility predict how many children will be born on average by women over their entire reproductive lifetime. These forecasts are important for policymakers and demographers, but little is known about their accuracy. We compare the accuracy of 13 methods for forecasting completed fertility, ranging from simple averages to complex Bayesian hierarchical models. We use data from 1950 to 2015 for 20 European countries to estimate the methods and evaluate their accuracy in out-of-sample forecasts. We find that forecast accuracy hardly improves with method complexity. The most accurate forecasts are obtained using simple averages of recent observations. Complex models are prone to overfitting and do not outperform simple methods. Our findings suggest that demographers and policymakers should be cautious about using complex models for forecasting completed fertility and that simple methods may be preferable.},

They are extensively encountered in health sciences to summarize data and to visualize the distribution of variables. However, histograms are not always the best choice, especially when the variable of interest is continuous. In this paper, we propose a new method to construct histograms that are smooth, unbiased, and have a reduced variance. The method is based on a Bayesian approach and uses P-splines to model the density. We show that our smooth histograms outperform classical histograms in terms of mean squared error and visual appearance. The method is illustrated with examples from the health sciences.},
